  <h1>Explanation</h1>

    <p>The JavaScript on this page is running a guessing game about my background.</p>
    <p>First it prompts for input on the user's name.</p>
    <p>Then it asks 3 yes/no questions.</p>
    <p>Next it returns an alert, either "yes" or "no".</p>
    <p>Based on the response, it then concatenates to either continue to the next question, or returns to the same one for a different answer.</p>
    <p>Finally, it congratulates the user on finishing the game!</p>
